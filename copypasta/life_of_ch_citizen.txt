Day in the life of a Chinese citizen
    - Be me, a responsible citizen of the Glorious land of China!
    - Live in Beijing
    - Wake up at 4 am to the 500 tons of carbon dioxide in my area
    - Eat deep fried urine eggs and stray dogs for breakfast
    - See my neighbour being executed by the CCP for making a mild joke about our glorious leader Xi
    Jinping
    - Try to go to factory but get stuck in the traffic for the 847th time
    - Finally reach the factory the next day
    - Start my 15 hour shift to manufacture power rangers themed dildos
    - Co-worker tries to commit suicide but the nets stopped him from falling
    - Do this for 7 years
    - Save up enough to buy my 5th house in hopes of getting married
    - Try to retrieve my money from the bank but all the accounts have been locked because of a
    housing bubble crisis
    - Reach home depressed to see guys in hazmat suits waiting for me to quarantine me for 50
    years
    - Watch state-authorised news channels and jack off to Xi Jinping's speeches
    - Go on reddit and twitter and insult Indians and Americans and uphold the name of the
    glorious CCP
    - Sleep after having a wonderful day in the prosperous and flawless land of CHINA!
